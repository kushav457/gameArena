How to plug in your existing FlapPyBird assets

1) Copy your desktop folder:
   FlapPyBird/assets/

   into this folder:
   client/public/game/flappyBird/assets/

So you get:
  client/public/game/flappyBird/assets/audio/...
  client/public/game/flappyBird/assets/sprites/...

2) Optional (only if you want sprite + sounds):
   This browser version looks for these files:
   - assets/sprites/bird.png
   - assets/audio/flap.wav
   - assets/audio/hit.wav
   - assets/audio/point.wav

If they don't exist, the game still runs using simple shapes.

3) Start the client and open:
   /one-tap/flappy-bird
